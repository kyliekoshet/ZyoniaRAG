# ZyoniaRAG Neighborhood Enrichment System

## üöÄ Overview

The ZyoniaRAG Neighborhood Enrichment System provides **intelligent neighborhood data collection** with **enhanced content extraction** and **confidence scoring** for RAG applications. The system automatically detects search categories, performs targeted web searches, creates high-quality JSON datasets, and assigns confidence scores to help RAG systems weight information appropriately.

## ‚ú® Current System Features

- **üéØ Smart Category Detection**: Automatically identifies query intent (crime, investment, cleanliness, etc.)
- **üîç Enhanced Content Extraction**: Scrapes meaningful content from web pages instead of relying on poor search snippets
- **üìä Confidence Scoring**: Assigns quality scores (0-100) to each source for RAG optimization
- **üì¶ Dual File Strategy**: Creates both individual category files AND comprehensive master files
- **üîó Complete URL Tracking**: All results include source URLs and enhanced snippets
- **‚ö° DuckDuckGo Integration**: Reliable web search with rate limiting management
- **üåç International Support**: Enhanced patterns for Spanish cities and worldwide locations

## üéØ Search Categories

The system automatically detects and searches for:

1. **crime_rate** - Safety, security, crime statistics
2. **cleanliness** - Environmental quality, maintenance, hygiene
3. **public_perception** - Reviews, opinions, resident experiences
4. **investment_potential** - Real estate market, property trends
5. **general_info** - Overview, amenities, local attractions

## üìä Confidence Scoring System

### **Purpose for RAG Applications**

The confidence scoring system assigns quality scores (0-100) to each search result, enabling RAG systems to:

- **Weight information appropriately** based on source reliability
- **Filter low-quality content** by setting confidence thresholds
- **Express uncertainty** when sources have low confidence scores
- **Prioritize authoritative sources** in multi-source responses

### **Scoring Methodology (0-100 Scale)**

#### **Domain Authority (40 points)**

Source reliability based on domain trustworthiness:

- **Government/Official (35-40)**: `gov.es`, `madrid.es`, `policia.es`, `ine.es`
- **Academic/Research (30-35)**: `edu`, `university`, research institutions
- **Established Media (25-30)**: `bbc.com`, `elpais.com`, `timeout.com`
- **Real Estate Platforms (20-28)**: `idealista.com`, `numbeo.com`, `fotocasa.es`
- **Travel/Review Sites (15-25)**: `tripadvisor.com`, `lonelyplanet.com`
- **Personal Blogs (5-15)**: `wordpress.com`, `blogspot.com`

#### **Content Quality (40 points)**

Analysis across multiple dimensions:

- **Neighborhood Specificity (0-10)**: How location-specific is the content?
- **Query Relevance (0-10)**: How well does it match the search intent?
- **Content Depth (0-10)**: Data-driven vs. opinion-based content
- **Data Richness (0-10)**: Contains statistics, percentages, concrete data

#### **Technical Quality (10 points)**

- **Content Enhancement (5)**: Successfully scraped vs. raw snippet
- **Content Length (3)**: Substantial vs. minimal information
- **URL Accessibility (2)**: Valid, accessible source

#### **Recency Estimate (10 points)**

- **Current Year (10)**: Contains 2025 data/updates
- **Recent Years (6-8)**: 2024, 2023 content
- **Recent Indicators (6)**: "Updated", "latest", "current"
- **Default (5)**: No clear recency indicators

### **Confidence Levels**

- **Very High (80-100)**: Government data, official statistics, academic research
- **High (65-79)**: Established media, reputable platforms with recent data
- **Medium (50-64)**: Mix of reliable and questionable sources
- **Low (35-49)**: Travel blogs, opinion sites, limited data
- **Very Low (0-34)**: Personal blogs, unreliable sources

### **RAG Integration Benefits**

```json
{
  "confidence_score": 85,
  "confidence_level": "very_high",
  "rag_weight": 0.85,
  "score_breakdown": {
    "domain_authority": 38,
    "content_quality": 32,
    "technical_quality": 8,
    "recency_estimate": 7
  }
}
```

**How RAG Systems Can Use This:**

- **Weighted Retrieval**: Multiply relevance scores by `rag_weight`
- **Source Filtering**: Only use sources above confidence threshold
- **Response Hedging**: "Based on high-confidence sources..." vs. "According to limited data..."
- **Multi-source Validation**: Cross-reference high-confidence sources

## üöÄ Quick Start

### Basic Neighborhood Search

```bash
# Simple search with automatic category detection
python3 search_neighborhood.py "Salamanca Madrid" "What's the crime rate?"

# Investment inquiry
python3 search_neighborhood.py "Chueca Madrid" "Good for real estate investment?"

# Public perception query
python3 search_neighborhood.py "La Latina Madrid" "What do people think about this neighborhood?"
```

### Master File Generation

```bash
# Create comprehensive master file for a neighborhood
cd external_enrichment
python3 -c "
from master_enrichment import MasterEnrichment
enricher = MasterEnrichment()
enricher.create_master_enrichment('Salamanca, Madrid', force_update=True)
"
```

## üéØ RAG Integration Strategies

### Granular Retrieval (Individual Files)

**Best For**: Specific, focused queries

```python
# Query: "Is Salamanca Madrid safe?"
# Strategy: Retrieve individual crime_rate file
# Benefit: Precise, fast response with minimal context
```

### Comprehensive Retrieval (Master Files)

**Best For**: General questions and comparative analysis

```python
# Query: "Tell me about living in Salamanca Madrid"
# Strategy: Retrieve master enrichment file
# Benefit: Complete neighborhood context across all categories
```

### Progressive Enhancement

**Best For**: Multi-turn conversations

```python
# Turn 1: "Safety in Salamanca?" ‚Üí Individual crime file
# Turn 2: "What about investment potential?" ‚Üí Upgrade to master file
# Benefit: Seamless context expansion
```

## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration

### Search Categories & Keywords

Located in `external_enrichment/config.py`:

```python
SEARCH_CATEGORIES = {
    "crime_rate": {
